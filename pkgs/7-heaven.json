	"description": "<p><i>Supports iOS 12</i></p>\n</p><p>Say welcome back to iOS 7.</p>\n<p>7-Heaven brings back the \"Free\" button in the App Store for when the app is free. And that's not all! It replaces the button with its iOS 7 counterpart regardless of the text, discards the \"In app purchases\" text in favor of the little + sign and most importantly, <b>it works in every language seamlessly!</b></p>\n<p><i>Note: this tweak is a fork of Free Market by Zachary Thomas Paul.</i></p>\n<p><i>No options to configure</i></p>",
